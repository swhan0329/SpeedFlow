# SpeedFlow
"SpeedFlow: Optical Flow-based Vehicle Speed Estimation" This project utilizes Farneback Optical Flow to estimate vehicle speed from CCTV footage. It visualizes motion using flow vectors, heatmaps, and real-time speed overlays to provide an intuitive and AI-free approach for vehicle tracking and velocity estimation.
